Thumbnailpolish usage notes 
rev. 2013-07-30

Requirements:
imagemagick, make, libav, python

Input requirements:
This tool starts from a (writeable) mirror of the Thumbnails directory,
which is expected to contain directories like

Thumbnails/L001/C1.1
Thumbnails/L001/C2.1
Thumbnails/L001/C3.1
...

Copy the Makefile into your mirror of the thumbnails directory and run

make configure

and then

make all

This step has to open and close a few hundred thousand files,
so it can take a long time.  It should create colorized thumbnails
of each tile in the same directories as the originals, no more.

After waiting for make all to finish, then run

tileimages.py

If all goes well, you should get intermediate per-lane images in the 
individual directories, and a directory called Thumbnails/wholeimages
that contains entire-flowcell composite images.

This may not work for you, and is guaranteed to break the next time
the illumina on-instrument software changes either its image formatting
conventions or its file naming conventions.
