# Thumbnailpolish
***

## Purpose
This package contains scripts that generate color composite images 
from the diagnostic "Thumbnails" generated by Illumina (TM) sequencing
instruments.  There are slightly different recipes for compositing
thumbnail images for different models of instrument.

## Prerequisites
This package depends on python, make, imagemagick, and libav.
The scripts at the moment require write access to the Thumbnails
directory or a copy of it.

## License
Thumbnail polish is under the BSD license; see LICENSE.
Distribution, modification and redistribution, incorporation
into other software, and pretty much everything else is allowed.
